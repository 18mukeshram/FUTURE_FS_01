      <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
        I focus on building frontend systems that are clean, maintainable, and
        easy to scale. I care deeply about layout discipline, component
        structure, and creating interfaces that feel calm and predictable to
        users.
      </p>

      <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        I approach projects with a product mindset, balancing frontend clarity
        with practical backend integration when required.
